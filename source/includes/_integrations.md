# Integrations

## Public Chains
Oraclize is integrated natively with the most widely used public blockchain protocols like the Ethereum, Bitcoin, Rootstock, EOS mainnets and testnets.

## Alternative Public Chains
Oraclize is constantly studying new public blockchain protocols and considering further blockchain integrations. Since the Oraclize Engine is completely blockchain agnostic and can interact via HTTP API, developers are encouraged to work on open-source independent Oraclize integration on the model of the Ethereum-Bridge.

## Private Ethereum-based Chains
Private, Ethereum-based chains can currently integrate with Oraclize by using the Ethereum-Bridge. Forks of Ethereum such as Monax included. More information on how to use the Ethereum-Bridge will become available in the [development tools](#development-tools) section or refer to this [StackExchange answer](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/11389/5819) describing how to use it alongside testrpc.

## Alternative Private Chains
The Oraclize team is currently investigating to create software for a native integration for alternative private distributed ledger protocols such as Corda, Chain and Hyperledger. Additional information are available on contacts.

## Non-blockchain Applications
The <a href="https://github.com/oraclize/oraclize-lib">oraclize-lib</a> enables the use of the Oraclize engine capabilities also in a non-blockchain context, by providing an abstraction layer which resolves to Oraclize HTTP API. The oraclize-lib is currently in an experimental stage.
